        To withdraw, you need to configure an address in your profile repository.
        That's a repository with a name that matches your GitHub username. Create this repository if you haven't done so already.
        Then add a cryptoactions.json file with the following content and fill in your address:

        ```
        {
          "ethereum": {
            "address": "0x..."
          }
        }
        ```

        You can change that address at any time.

        Alternatively you can add a "cryptoactions" section in a package.json file.

        ```
        "cryptoactions": {
          "ethereum": {
            "address": "0x..."
          }
        }
        ```

        That's it. Now enter the URL of the issue.
        If you are eligible to withdraw the bounty, it will be sent to your configured address immediately.
